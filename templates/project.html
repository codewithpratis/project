<p>Project Overview</p>

<p>
  <ul class="a">
    We started out with the jupyter notebook to import the CSV file that we downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand" target="_blank">Kaggle DataSet. </a>
    We used pandas, matplotlib, and Numpy methods to manupulate the data. After manipulating the data, we had alot of questions that we wanted to answer.
    Some of the questions that we wanted to tackle were: 
    <li>
    How many bookings were canceled and not?
  </li>
  <li>
    Which hotel is more popular?
  </li>
  <li>
    How much of bookings were done each year?
  </li>
  <li>
    Which year was the busiest?
  </li>
  <li>
    Did Deposit Type have any effects on cancelations?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is a correlations between lead time and cancelations?
  </li>
  <li>
    How did people booked the room?
    What's the most popular way to book the room?
  </li>
  <li>
    Out of singles, couples, and family, who were the most popular ones to stay in the hotel?
  </li>
  <hr>
  <b><center>However, the main questions is how can these all be the predictor of the cancelations that happened over the years?</center></b>
  <br>
  In order to answer this question, we used Machine Learning method by applying Machine Learning Libraries such as:
  <li>
    Sklearn
  </li>
  <li>
    Tensor Flow
  </li>

  So we used these ML libraries to predict the cancelations.

  <b><center>Factors Influencing Hotel Cancelations</center></b>
  
  <b>Observation Analysis</b>
<li>
  We found out that the prediction was 77.4% accurate.
</li>
<li>
  We used pandas get dummies function, which made it easier since it encodes the categorical data.
</li>
<li>
  We decided to limit the number of epochs to 20 after looking at the original 100. 
</li>
<li>
  The accuracy and loss changed slightly after epoch 6.
</li>
<li>
  When we plot the data, 77% of the data seems to be accurately predicted.
</li>
<br>
<hr>
<b><center>Obstacles/Issues Encountered</center></b>
<li>
  We had little hard time using the get dummies function to convert the categorical data into the number of feature to be used. 
</li>
<li>
  Each value became its own column. 
</li>
<li>
  Doing it this way, could have made for a huge number of columns depending on the number of different values of categorical data in each column.
</li>
<li>
  We also had a difficulty finding the meaning of calculated result loss of 0.45, which we calculated using categorical cross entropy
</li>
